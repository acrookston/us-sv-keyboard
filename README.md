# Introduction

This is a custom keyboard input source for people who primarily wish to use a
US-english keyboard layout but need quick an easy access to Swedish (sv-se)
special characters åäö and ÅÄÖ.

I find it extremely useful when programming. US keyboard is just much better
for programming but I need quick access to special characters for communications.

The keyboard layout does the following replacements from the traditional US-en
keyboard layout:

- `“ = å (Alt + [)`
- `” = ä (Shift + Alt + [)`
- `æ = ö (Alt + ')`
- `Æ = Å (Shift + Alt + ')`
- `… = Ä (Alt + ;)`
- `Ú = Ö (Shift Alt + ;)`

Similar to where those keys would be on Swedish (sv-se) keyboard.


# Installation

- `git clone https://github.com/acrookston/us-sv-keyboard`
- `cd us-sv-keyboard`
- `cp U.S.\ -\ SE.* ~/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/`
- Open OS X Settings -> Input Sources and select your new keyboard layout

If you can't find the new keyboard layout you may need to log out and in again.

This has been tested on Mac OS X 10.6 (maybe even 10.5, I forgot) all the way to 10.9.
